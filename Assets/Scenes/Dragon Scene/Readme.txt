Dragon design doc (ideas)

- Dragon will fly around the player, coming from left to right and right to left and from back to front and front to back.
- While flying dragon will go up and down, leaving his eyes exposed to be shoot by the player.
- To kill a dragon, player must shoot at both of his eyes. If we want to make it harder, we can make the dragon heal 
    its wounded eye after a period of time.
- Dragon will shoot 1 or more fireballs to the player when both of them. If fireball touch the player, it dies.
